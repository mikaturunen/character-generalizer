# Cthulhu Character Generator

A super simple module that creates a valid character for Cthulhu the roleplaying game. This allows for quick generation of characters for a randomg group of people. You do not have to go through the hassle of setting everyone up. Just tell the module how many you want and it'll roll till it'll drop and create the set of characters for you.

Only thing left for you to do as the Game Master is to lead the players through the world of Cthulhu.

Enjoy!

## Running the Cthulhu character generator

    npm install cthulhu-character-generator
    node --harmony node_modules/cthulhu-character-generator

## Anything else?

The whole thing is built on top of EcmaScript 6 features and requires --harmony flag to run on Node.js. Module internally relies heavily on promises.
